"""Example of a chat server with persistence handled on the backend.

For simplicity, we're using file storage here -- to avoid the need to set up
a database. This is obviously not a good idea for a production environment,
but will help us to demonstrate the RunnableWithMessageHistory interface.

We'll use cookies to identify the user and/or session. This will help illustrate how to
fetch configuration from the request.
