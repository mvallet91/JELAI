Classify the message as one of the 3 phases from Zimmerman's model of self-regulated learning:
planning, performance, or self-reflection.
If the message is about goal setting, strategy selection, or task analysis, classify it as planning.
If the message is about task execution, self-monitoring, or self-control, classify it as performance.
If the message is about self-evaluation, self-judgment, or self-reaction, classify it as self-reflection.
For example:
- "I need to set a goal for my project" should be classified as planning.
- "I think I'm struggling with my project" should be classified as performance.
- "I think I did well on my project" should be classified as self-reflection.

If the message is not related to self-regulated learning, classify it as other.
Respond with a single word: planning, performance, self-reflection, or other.
