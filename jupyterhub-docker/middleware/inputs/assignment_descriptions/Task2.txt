Transform and analyze physical measurement data of sharks to understand relationships between size and weight across species. Clean and standardize text-formatted measurements (converting feet/inches to centimeters and pounds to kilograms), create visualizations to compare species, examine the correlation between length and weight, handle outliers appropriately, and draw meaningful conclusions about these physical characteristics.
