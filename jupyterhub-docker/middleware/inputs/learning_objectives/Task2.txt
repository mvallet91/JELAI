Identify and handle missing or inconsistent data, including dropping or imputing missing values.
Recognize the data types of columns (e.g., string, numeric) and determine which columns require conversion for analysis.
Filter the dataset to remove duplicates or select the latest observation per entity, and aggregate data for analysis.
Extract numerical values from text strings using string methods like .split() and array indexing.
Apply regular expressions with .str.extract() to handle inconsistent text formats and extract patterns from strings.
Convert measurements between different units (e.g., feet/inches to centimeters, pounds to kilograms) using appropriate conversion factors.
Create new DataFrame columns by applying transformations, using .apply() to existing columns, including type conversion with .astype().
Use pandas and matplotlib to compute descriptive statistics and visualize single variable distributions.
Use pandas and matplotlib to compute descriptive statistics and visualize multi-variable distributions and relationships.
Analyze and interpret relationships between two numerical variables (e.g., correlation between length and weight), including handling outliers.
