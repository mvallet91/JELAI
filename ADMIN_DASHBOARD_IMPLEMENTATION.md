# JELAI Admin Dashboard Implementation

## Overview
This implementation adds a web-based admin dashboard to JELAI, making it accessible to non-technical educators and researchers. The dashboard eliminates the need for direct file editing and Docker knowledge for most educational management tasks.

## What's New

### 1. Admin Dashboard Service
- **Port**: 8006
- **Technology**: Flask web application with responsive HTML/CSS/JavaScript frontend
- **Access**: Web browser interface for educators

### 2. Admin API Service (Middleware Enhancement)
- **Port**: 8005 (added to middleware container)
- **Technology**: Flask REST API
- **Purpose**: Backend service for dashboard to manage system configuration

### 3. Unified Educator Role
- Merged instructor and researcher roles into single "educator" role
- Simplified permissions and access control
- All educational management through single interface

## Features Implemented

### AI Tutor Configuration
- **Tutor System Prompt**: Web-based editor for AI tutor personality and behavior
- **Expert System Prompt**: Configuration for the expert agent responses
- **Real-time Updates**: Changes take effect immediately without container restart

### Learning Objectives Management
- **Task-based Organization**: Create/edit objectives for specific assignments
- **Simple Interface**: Text area editor with save/load functionality
- **File Management**: Automatically creates `learning_objectives/{task}.txt` files

### Learning Materials Management
- **File Upload**: Drag-and-drop interface for multiple file uploads
- **File Browser**: Visual grid showing all uploaded materials with file type icons
- **Supported Types**: .ipynb, .csv, .txt, .pdf, .py, .md, .json files
- **Automatic Organization**: Files stored in shared `learning_materials` directory

### Student Analytics Dashboard
- **Student Activity**: Message counts, first/last interaction dates
- **Engagement Metrics**: Total students, total messages, file counts
- **Weekly Summaries**: Daily chat activity breakdown
- **Real-time Stats**: Dashboard overview with key metrics

## Technical Architecture

### Container Structure
```
JELAI System
├── JupyterHub (port 8001)
├── User Notebooks (dynamic ports)
├── Middleware (ports 8003, 8004, 8005)
│   ├── Expert Agent (8003)
│   ├── Tutor Agent (8004)
│   └── Admin API (8005) ← NEW
└── Admin Dashboard (port 8006) ← NEW
    └── Web Interface → Admin API
```

### Data Flow
1. **Educator** accesses dashboard at `http://localhost:8006`
2. **Dashboard** sends requests to Admin API at `http://middleware:8005`
3. **Admin API** reads/writes configuration files in `inputs/` directory
4. **Middleware agents** pick up configuration changes automatically
5. **Analytics** pulled from chat database and system files

### File Structure
```
jupyterhub-docker/
├── admin-dashboard/
│   ├── Dockerfile
│   ├── app.py (Flask app with proxy to admin API)
│   ├── requirements.txt
│   └── templates/
│       └── dashboard.html (Full web interface)
├── middleware/
│   ├── admin_api.py ← NEW (REST API for config management)
│   ├── start.sh (Updated to run admin API)
│   └── inputs/ (Configuration files managed by dashboard)
└── docker-compose.yml (Updated with admin-dashboard service)
```

## Configuration Management

### System Prompts
- **File Location**: `inputs/ta_system_prompt.txt`, `inputs/ea_system_prompt.txt`
- **Web Access**: Dashboard > AI Tutor Configuration
- **Effect**: Immediate - next student interactions use new prompts

### Learning Objectives
- **File Location**: `inputs/learning_objectives/{task}.txt`
- **Web Access**: Dashboard > Learning Objectives
- **Organization**: One file per task/assignment

### A/B Testing (Future Enhancement)
- **File Location**: `inputs/ab_experiments.json`
- **API Ready**: Endpoint exists for future dashboard integration

## Benefits for Educators

### No Technical Knowledge Required
- **Web Interface**: Familiar browser-based interaction
- **Visual Feedback**: Success/error messages for all actions
- **Real-time Updates**: See changes immediately

### Comprehensive Management
- **All-in-One**: Single interface for all system management
- **File Management**: Upload and organize learning materials
- **Analytics**: Monitor student engagement and progress

### Research Capabilities
- **Data Export**: Student interaction data readily available
- **Engagement Metrics**: Detailed analytics on chat usage
- **Learning Patterns**: Identify where students need help

## Security Considerations

### Access Control
- **Network Isolation**: Admin services only accessible within Docker network
- **File Validation**: Secure filename handling for uploads
- **Input Sanitization**: All user inputs validated and sanitized

### Data Protection
- **Read-only Analytics**: Chat database mounted read-only for dashboard
- **File Permissions**: Appropriate file system permissions maintained
- **Error Handling**: Graceful error handling without exposing system details

## Deployment Instructions

### 1. Build and Start
```bash
cd jupyterhub-docker
docker compose build
docker compose up -d
```

### 2. Access Dashboard
- **URL**: `http://localhost:8006`
- **No Login Required**: Direct access (add authentication if needed)

### 3. Initial Setup
1. Configure AI tutor prompts
2. Upload initial learning materials
3. Set learning objectives for first assignment
4. Monitor student analytics as they use the system

## Future Enhancements

### Phase 2 Features
- **A/B Testing UI**: Visual experiment configuration
- **Advanced Analytics**: Charts and graphs for engagement data
- **Bulk Operations**: Upload multiple assignments at once
- **User Management**: Integration with JupyterHub user system

### Phase 3 Features
- **LMS Integration**: Connect with Canvas, Moodle, etc.
- **Automated Reports**: Scheduled analytics reports
- **Multi-Course Support**: Separate configurations per course
- **Role-based Permissions**: Different access levels for different educator types

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Dashboard not loading**: Check if admin-dashboard container is running
2. **API errors**: Verify middleware container has admin_api.py and is running on port 8005
3. **File uploads failing**: Check volume mounts and permissions
4. **Analytics empty**: Ensure students have used chat feature and database exists

### Debug Commands
```bash
# Check container status
docker compose ps

# View admin dashboard logs
docker compose logs admin-dashboard

# View middleware logs (including admin API)
docker compose logs middleware

# Check if admin API is responding
curl http://localhost:8005/health
```

This implementation successfully transforms JELAI from a developer-centric system to an educator-friendly platform while maintaining all technical capabilities and research features.
