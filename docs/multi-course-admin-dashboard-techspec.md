# Multi-Course Admin Dashboard Technical Specification

## Overview
This document outlines the technical design and implementation plan for the Multi-Course Admin Dashboard feature, as described in the corresponding Product Requirements Document (PRD). The goal is to provide a clear, actionable guide for developers to implement the feature, ensuring all functional requirements and acceptance criteria are met.

## 1. Functional Requirements Summary
- Provide a dashboard for administrators to view and manage multiple courses.
- Display aggregated and per-course analytics, user lists, and activity summaries.
- Enable filtering, searching, and sorting of course and user data.
- Support role-based access control (RBAC) for admin features.
- Integrate with existing data sources (databases, files, APIs) for real-time updates.
- Ensure responsive, user-friendly UI accessible via web browser.

## 2. Integration Points in Current Codebase
- **admin-dashboard/**: Contains the current admin dashboard backend (`app.py`), frontend templates, and static assets. This is the primary integration point for new dashboard features.
- **middleware/**: Hosts APIs and utilities for analytics, user data, and course management. Likely source for data aggregation and business logic.
- **user-notebook/**: May provide user activity data and logs relevant for analytics.
- **analysis/**: Contains scripts and notebooks for data analysis, which may be leveraged for advanced analytics features.

## 3. Implementation Steps

### 3.1. Data Model & Backend API
- Extend or refactor existing data models to support multiple courses, users, and analytics.
- Update or create new API endpoints in `middleware/admin_api.py` for:
  - Fetching course lists, user lists, and analytics data.
  - Filtering, searching, and sorting operations.
  - Role-based access checks.
- Ensure APIs return data in a format suitable for frontend consumption (e.g., JSON).
- Integrate with existing databases or files as required for real-time data.

### 3.2. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- Define admin roles and permissions in the backend.
- Implement RBAC checks in API endpoints and dashboard routes.
- Ensure only authorized users can access or modify admin dashboard features.

### 3.3. Frontend Dashboard UI
- Update or create new templates in `admin-dashboard/templates/` (e.g., `dashboard.html`).
- Implement dashboard views for:
  - Course overview (list, search, filter, sort).
  - Per-course analytics and user lists.
  - Aggregated analytics across courses.
- Use or extend existing static assets (`dashboard.js`, `dashboard.css`) for interactivity and styling.
- Ensure responsive design for various screen sizes.

### 3.4. Analytics & Real-Time Updates
- Integrate with analytics data sources (middleware, analysis scripts, or logs).
- Implement backend logic to aggregate and serve analytics data per course and across courses.
- Support real-time or periodic updates (e.g., via polling or websockets if required).

### 3.5. Testing & Validation
- Write unit and integration tests for new backend APIs and RBAC logic.
- Add frontend tests for dashboard UI components and user flows.
- Validate data accuracy, access control, and UI responsiveness.

### 3.6. Documentation & Deployment
- Update project documentation to describe new endpoints, data models, and dashboard features.
- Ensure deployment scripts/configs (e.g., Dockerfiles, compose files) include new dependencies if any.

## 4. Assumptions & Open Questions
- Assumes existing user and course data is accessible via current middleware or can be extended.
- Assumes admin authentication is already implemented; if not, must be added.
- Clarification needed on analytics granularity and update frequency (real-time vs. batch).
- Confirm if any third-party integrations or external APIs are required.

## 5. Acceptance Criteria Checklist
- [ ] Dashboard displays all courses and allows filtering/searching/sorting.
- [ ] Per-course and aggregated analytics are accurate and up-to-date.
- [ ] User lists and activity summaries are accessible per course.
- [ ] Only authorized admins can access dashboard features (RBAC enforced).
- [ ] UI is responsive and user-friendly.
- [ ] All new code is tested and documented.
